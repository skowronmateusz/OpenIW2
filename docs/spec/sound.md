# Sound

## Files

Shipped sounds are `sound/**.wav` (20,188 files, all RIFF WAVE with 16-bit PCM; 19 are stereo) plus 71 `.mp3`
files (music; not decoded yet). Checked by scanning every `.wav` in the packs.

## Sound aliases (`soundaliases/*.csv`)

CSV text. Rows whose first field is empty or starts with `#` are ignored. The first remaining row names the
columns (`name,sequence,file,vol_min,vol_max,vol_mod,pitch_min,pitch_max,dist_min,dist_max,channel,type,
probability,loop,masterslave,loadspec,subtitle,compression,secondaryaliasname,volumefalloffcurve,startdelay,
speakermap,reverb,lfe percentage`), and columns are found by that name. Several rows may share a name; one of them
is picked at random when the alias plays. `file` is relative to `sound/`.

`loadspec` limits a row to levels: `!a !b` excludes levels `a` and `b`; a plain list includes only the listed
levels; empty means every level.

## Playback (implemented in `src/audio/sound.cpp`; inferred)

- Volume and pitch are drawn uniformly from their min..max ranges.
- `channel local` plays without position. Other sounds fall off linearly from full volume at `dist_min` to
  silence at `dist_max` (10 × `dist_min` when `dist_max` is empty). The `.vfcurve` fall-off curves are not used yet.
- Panning is constant-power by the side component of the direction to the listener.
- `loop looping` repeats the sound until stopped; `secondaryaliasname` starts a second alias with the first.

## Script built-ins

`playsound(alias [, notify])` plays at the entity (without position on the player); with a notify name the
entity gets that notify when the sound ends. Also `playsoundasmaster`, `playlocalsound`, `playloopsound`,
`stoploopsound`, `ambientplay`, `ambientstop`, `musicplay`, `musicstop`. Weapon shots play the weapon's
`fireSoundPlayer` (player) or `fireSound` (others); reloading and rechambering play `reloadSound` and
`rechamberSound`.
