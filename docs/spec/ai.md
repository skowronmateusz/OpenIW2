# AI actors

Sources: `CoD2SP_s.exe` (1.3) analyzed with REA: `FUN_00524570` (per-class script loading),
`FUN_00524270` (engine animscripts), `FUN_005241b0` (script+label lookup).

## Script loading (observed)

- For every map entity whose classname starts with `actor_`, the engine loads `aitype/<classname without
  "actor_">` and looks up three labels in it (the shipped files define `main`, `spawner` and `precache`).
- Entities with an `animscript` key load `animscripts/traverse/<value>`. `misc_mg42`/`misc_turret` load the
  animscript named by their weapon info.
- The engine loads these animscripts: `combat`, `concealment_crouch`, `concealment_prone`, `concealment_stand`,
  `cover_crouch`, `cover_left`, `cover_prone`, `cover_right`, `cover_stand`, `cover_wide_left`, `cover_wide_right`,
  `death`, `grenade_return_throw`, `init`, `pain`, `move`, `scripted`, `stop`, `grenade_cower` (strings at
  0x587e50–0x587f4c). These are the AI state scripts the engine starts as the actor's state changes.

## Spawning (implemented; partly inferred)

- `actor_*` entities are spawners. Those without spawnflag 1 (`SPAWNER`, described in the aitype headers as
  "makes this a spawner instead of a guy") spawn an AI at load.
- `dospawn()` / `stalingradspawn()` on a spawner create an AI. It copies the spawner's key/values, decrements
  `count`, runs `aitype main()` with `self` = the AI, notifies the spawner `"spawned"` with the AI, and starts
  `animscripts/init::main()`. The errors "dospawn can only be called on actor spawners" and "Spawner at (%g %g %g)
  is in solid" exist in the executable.

## Not yet specified

The engine's AI state machine (when `stop`, `move`, `combat`, `cover_*`, `pain` and `death` run), path finding,
and target selection.
